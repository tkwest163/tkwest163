### :wave: Hi there, my name is Taylor 

I am a Junior Software Dev with a background in Emergency Medicine and Firefighting :fire:

As as South Texas based individual I am interested in honing my skills in DevOps and Cloud Engineering. I seek to be more involved in creating applications that better serve the first responder and LGBTQ+ community. 

I have experience in HTML, CSS, and Javascript; my in-the-works projects involve Python, as well.

In my free time you can find me drinking coffee and spending time with family/friends!

Contact me through my LinkedIn, lets get in touch :speech_balloon:
